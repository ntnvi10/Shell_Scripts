Difference between function and loops
Function - formulaes in maths like percent
In any programming languuage, we make the formuales (or function)(there are some fixed steps or piece of code), 
so that we don't need to write again the piece of code that defines the fucntion.

we might need the same block of function code in a different program or in the same program at different lines, that's why we make the fucntion.
conclusion, fucntion is a block of code that we need at different times during one program or in different programs.

Loop - continue repeat the some piece of code over a certain line.
at the same place

Syntax - function_name() {
                statement
                  }
                  
Calling a function - function_name arguments;

Passing parameter to a fucntion: 
----------------x----------------
Example: check two numbers are equal:-
a=1 b=1
check() {
        echo "comparing $1 and $2"
        if [ $1 -eq $2 ]; then
          echo "numbers are equal"
        else
          echo "numbers aren't equal"
        fi
  }

check $a $b

c=2 d=3
check $c $d

-------------------x------------
Return Values from Functions:-

a fucntion runs a particular code and returns to the same line from where it was executed or invoked.
by default a function will run everything and after the last line it will return, unless you specify return in the function

when a fucntion is returning, there'll be a value that it will be returning.
Example:-

a=1 b=1
check() {
        echo "comparing $1 and $2"
        if [ $1 -eq $2 ]; then
          echo "numbers are equal"
        return 007 #you can give any value and that will be reutrned instead of the exit status.
        else
          echo "numbers aren't equal"
        fi
        echo "x----completed check $1 and $2----x"
  }
#here since first condition is met, so it'll reutrn back to the place from where it was invoked without going through the second echo(after if)
check
var=$?
echo "**first time var = $var**"

echo " "
#here since first condition isn't met, it'll go throught all the lines of the function and reutrn the value of exit status 0
c=2 d=3
check $c $d
var=$?
echo "**second time var = $var**"
