${parameter} - parameter substitution
$(command) - command substitution

echo $(date) - gives date output ✅, command date already exists and hence we get the output.
echo ${date} - no output ❌, as it looks for a variable named date, which is not defined.

${var%string} - deletes the shortest match of string in $var from END
${var#string} - deltes the shortest match of string in $var from START

name=cat.txt
echo ${name%txt}text - output: cat.text; deletes txt from the end and substitute it with text at the end.
echo rat${name#cat} - output: rat.txt; deletes cat from the start and substitute it with rat at the start.
